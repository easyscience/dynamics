Launching point for the EasyDynamics family of repositories

This repository is just a document with links to other repositories, which constitute the building blocks of the EasyDynamics project, part of the larger [Easy Science](https://easyscience.software) framework.
This ecosystem is divided into source code repositories, documentation repositories, and dependent project repositories to help both developers and end-users interact with our tools.

## Source code

[EasyDynamicsApp](https://github.com/easyscience/dynamics-app) - This is the main application repository. It is currently under construction.

[EasyDynamicsLib](https://github.com/easyscience/dynamics-lib) - This repository contains the core library accessible through the Jupyter Notebook/Python. It is currently under construction.

## Documentation

The documentation is currently under construction. 

## Main dependencies

[EasyApp](https://github.com/easyScience/easyApp) - Application skeleton for the EasyScience framework, written in QML.
[EasyCore](https://github.com/easyScience/easyCore) - Core library with fitting, minimizer, constraints, etc.
